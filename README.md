# LocationMate
Locationmate is an android application that helps people pinpoint a friend's location in a workplace or university setting with no real usage of internet. While the app was built for BML Munjal University and was tested there, it can be customized for any large campus that has Wifi availability.

## How it works
We mapped the BSSIDs of numerous wireless access points located throughout our university to unique locations. The app works by finding the BSSID of the nearest access point and retrieving the respective location from our BSSID-location database.
